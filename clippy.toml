# Clippy configuration for meld project
# This file documents our linting standards and can be used to configure clippy behavior

# Treat warnings as errors in CI
# This is enforced via the -D warnings flag in our pre-commit hooks and CI

# Common lints we want to enforce:
# - dead_code: Find unused code
# - unnecessary_lazy_evaluations: Avoid unnecessary closures
# - unnecessary_cast: Avoid redundant type casts
# - useless_conversion: Avoid redundant conversions
# - len_zero: Prefer is_empty() over len() > 0
# - clone_on_copy: Avoid cloning Copy types
# - derivable_impls: Use #[derive] when possible

# These are all enforced via -D warnings which treats all warnings as errors

# If we need to allow specific lints in certain cases, we can add them here:
# [lints]
# allowed = [
#     "clippy::some_lint_we_need_to_allow",
# ]
